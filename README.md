# esp8266-projects

This repository is used to house sample projects for the ESP8266 microcontroller. Mostly, this will be used to house example code that I put in [my blog] [blog] related to the ESP8266.

So far, this repository contains:

* blink - The "Hello World" of microcontrollers! Simply blinks a LED on/off every second. From [this blog post] [blinkpost].

All code in this repository is under the "unlicence", which means that you can use it in your own projects without worrying about its compatibility with the licence of your code.
